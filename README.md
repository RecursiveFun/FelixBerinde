- 👋 Hi, I’m Felix.
- 👀 I’m interested in Mobile Application Development and Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my BS in Software Development from Western Governors University. I spend a majority of my time studying or working where I'm currently an IT Technician wearing many hats. The rest of my time is spent with my wife and dog, playing video games, or enjoying the outdoors.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who wants to learn and is willing to put in the effort to obtaining that goal.
- 📫 How to reach me fberind@wgu.edu
- 📚 Currently learning C# and refining my HTML/CSS/JS/SQL skills.
